There exists a particular place I continually seek when I wish to summon a memory in all its intricate detail.

## It Is Not an Extraordinary Destination,

Yet it possesses a value far beyond mere vistas or ambiance.

Each time the world accelerates around me, and distances widen, I inevitably return to this sanctuary. Here, removed from the frenetic pulse of life, I sit in quietude, allowing my thoughts to drift freely, revisiting those moments when stories and laughter were exchanged effortlessly.

This place carries a kind of magic—each fragment of it seemingly etched with every word and smile that ever passed between us. It is as if nothing has ever truly departed from memory—something palpable, something profoundly precious.

On occasion, in its serene silence, I attempt to recall the inception of it all. That beginning often appears blurred, yet in the smallest, once-overlooked details,

> I now recognize their depth.

There were instances spent together when time itself seemed to pause. To live in that instant, without distraction—where there was nothing to do but lie side by side, gazing into one another’s eyes as though that was the sole thing that mattered in the world. Such warmth, unlike any other.

In the stillness of this place, one question often reverberates within me:

## Have I forgotten?

It arises persistently, as if echoing from within the chambers of my own mind. Have I truly believed I have forgotten all that we once shared? Have those moments dissolved into oblivion? Perhaps it is only I who still confront these recollections. Yet, with each return to this place, the answer remains constant:

## I Have Not Forgotten—

How could I forget what gave me conviction in times when I believed in nothing? And this place, with its every nuance, serves as undeniable proof that it has never ceased to occupy my thoughts. Even as time moves on and distance intervenes, I find that I have never truly forgotten, for each return fills the emptiness with the presence of those memories. As if you are still here, beside me, bridging the divides of time.

I often wonder:

> Do you, too, feel this? Is there a place to which you return to remember me, as I return here to remember you?

Perhaps the answer will forever remain beyond reach.

Something that once felt so undeniable now begins to fade. Something that once made me surrender completely, without reservation. I attempt to capture it once more, to recall the smallest details that once made it so significant to me. Yet, as time marches forward, it becomes ever more elusive, lost in the inexorable current of days that continue to flow.

I yearn for it here, at this lake, where we once passed time together, when only the moon and stars accompanied our presence. Yet now, as I seek to remember, all that remains are but faint echoes, leaving behind a lingering ache that remains unanswered.

And thus, all that remains is uncertainty. I am unsure of what to think of it. On one hand, I feel as though much of what I once held has been lost. Yet, on the other, there exists a part of me that remains tethered to that fleeting moment, however faint.

## This Lake Has Always Been the Place Where I Attempt to Make Sense of These Feelings,

where I search for answers to the questions that persist, the fears that linger just at the edge of my consciousness.

I often tell myself that time will halt in that perfect instant. Yet, reality invariably calls us back, pulling us away from that shared bond. I find myself pretending, hoping that we are still there, still exchanging that quiet smile, holding on to the hope that one day we will find our way back to that place, where we might again experience that peace.
