### The Sky is Filled with the Shimmering Stars and the Moon that Shines Brightly,

Standing at the edge of the lake, I gaze at the brilliance of a luminous object floating in the night sky.

Its allure begins to captivate a mute man such as myself with every glance, touching my soul, lulling my heart with an unspoken magic. In its presence, I feel beckoned to reflect, to dream, and to contemplate my heart, while also becoming a balm amidst the tumult of the past.

### It Has Always Remained a Faithful Companion in Solitude,

With its tranquil presence, I feel at ease to be myself without the fear of judgment or condemnation. A smile spreads across my face as beautiful moments align with the moon's light, which touches my thoughts.

Every passing moment shared feels so precious, becoming part of a beauty that soothes.

The breeze caresses my face, making me reflect on how valuable it is to have a presence that can silently bear witness to every heartbeat.

Stepping closer, **I attempt to touch it,** but only find droplets of water, and the small waves I create have disrupted the beauty reflected upon its surface.

**Realizing that I can only gaze upon it without possessing it,** I allow myself to accept the reality, slowly retreating, forming a safeguard that I may always appreciate its beauty, even if it is not in my grasp.

Looking back at the moon's brilliance, I speak to what holds my heart, **how truly beautiful the feeling entrusted to me was,** returning after its near extinction.

How I have finally found the courage to send forth prayers I no longer recall when I last sent them into the sky. And I leave a message to its reflection,
