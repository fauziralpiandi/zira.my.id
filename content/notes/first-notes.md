summary: I’m still proud of my drawings. So if there’s another contest, I still won’t color my drawing.

I really love drawing. Since I was little, I’ve always been happy whenever we had to draw in school. Until now, I’ve joined four drawing contests at the district level! But I always get second place.

I remember the first contest, I drew a mountain, a rice field, and a morning sun. My teacher said my drawing was nice! But I didn’t color it. I don’t like coloring. I think just the lines are enough to make a cool drawing.

In the second contest, I drew a traditional Sundanese house. I was really happy with it, but I still didn’t color it.

The third and fourth contests were the same. I still didn’t color my drawing. I know the judges probably like colorful drawings more. But I didn’t want to color it because I don’t like it. I prefer my drawings as they are, without anything extra.

My teacher said that’s why I never get first place. But it’s okay. I’m still proud of my drawings.

So if there’s another contest, I still won’t color my drawing.
