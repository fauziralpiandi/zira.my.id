summary: Fr, her ass out here pulling doggy moves like loyalty’s a threesome—I’m over it.

Used to hearing all the gossip, annoying opinions, and bad reviews about this whole thing...

Feels like the world’s watching every move: lowkey judging w/ a tiny smirk.

<br />

But on the flip side: intuition be hella loud.

<br />

Ever get that something’s off vibe? Same. Try to ignore it, but that feeling’s always there, like background noise you just can’t mute.

Wanna prove to myself: still can be open, still can feel heavy stuff but it makes life colorful. Sometimes I straight-up ignore the warning signs. Red flags blur out, brain knows it all, but heart’s like: let’s roll anyway...

Honestly, short fuse, dramatic at times, but then chill mode kicks in. Just observing, staying aware, thinking what am I even doing?

Also, not always wise—

Sometimes dumb, sometimes slip up, but self-awareness is like a tiny armor. Or intentionally reckless sometimes, testing limits.

At least I know boundaries, so I don’t go fully lost.

Who doesn’t wanna be loved for real?! Not the messy, pain-bringing kind (like sneaky side stuff for a years lol). Simple, damn!

<br />

Friends throwing advice: bro, this ain’t worth it...

Yeah, they right. Sometimes gotta walk solo to actually learn. Don’t wanna mess up again. Past mistakes? Harsh reminders: be careful, but don’t over-paranoid either. Past exp taught me: don’t get too attached to someone who doesn’t respect you at all. Painful, but necessary lesson...

Risks exist, and that’s life. Kinda funny, but also relief: you don’t feel anything new, but that’s fine.

<br />

Best part?

Idk, suddenly not feeling w/ you… hush!

Can’t go further. Just the vibe, emitting the feels—fr, nothing else matters in that moment.

<br />

Stupid, really… i know!
