## 1. Eligibility

**You must be at least 13 years old to use this site**. By continuing to use this site, you confirm that you meet this age requirement and have the right to access and use the site. Users under the age of 13 are advised to obtain parental or guardian consent before accessing or using this site. This restriction is applied for several important reasons, aimed at protecting all parties involved:

1. **Compliance with Legal Regulations**  
   This site is designed to comply with applicable regulations in various countries. By setting the age limit at 13 years, I ensure that this site does not collect personal information from children under this age without the consent of their parents or guardians, helping us avoid potential legal issues.

2. **Security and Protection for Young Users**  
   Children under the age of 13 may not fully understand the risks of the online world, including exposure to inappropriate or harmful content. By establishing this age restriction, I can offer a safer and more controlled experience for visitors, reducing risks that might arise.

3. **Privacy Protection and Data Management**  
   I am committed to protecting users' privacy. By limiting access for those under the age of 13, I minimize the risk of collecting personal data from individuals who may not be mature enough to understand and manage their personal information. Data protection is crucial, and I aim to ensure that personal data is only collected and used in a lawful and secure manner.
4. **Parental or Guardian Responsibility**  
   I encourage the role of parents or guardians in monitoring and overseeing their children's online activities. With this age restriction, I provide parents with an opportunity to more easily control their children's access and ensure that the content they view is appropriate for their age and understanding level.

5. **Avoiding Exposure to Inappropriate Content**  
   While I provide content that is beneficial and suitable for various audiences, I recognize that some materials might still be inappropriate or misinterpreted by younger children. Therefore, by implementing this age limit, I ensure that visitors to the site are better able to understand and evaluate the information presented in a more mature manner.
