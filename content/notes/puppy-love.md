The world trembles with the noise of adolescent dreams, unfolding a stage of illusions.

## Puppy Love?

They, barely wading through the ocean of emotions, often find themselves ensnared in delicate webs that appear beautiful yet are laced with venom. Like bright flowers blooming in a desert, the love they revere is but a mirage—deceptively alluring, yet hollow.

They tread blindly through dark corridors where shadows of false affection linger. Every smile is a mask, every word a fragment of broken poetry. In intoxicating naivety, they abandon their identities for feelings born of myths whispered in their ears.

> You are everything,

Murmurs a teenager, gazing blankly at their lover.

> Without you, I am nothing.

Yet deep within, buried beneath layers of doubt, a quiet voice cries out—

> Is this love, or merely possession?

Trapped in fleeting satisfaction, they spin in a cacophony of illusions. Artificial joy conceals unspoken pain. Every laugh, every tear, is ensnared in this game. But when night falls, and the moonlight pierces the fog, clarity begins to emerge, like shards of light breaking through a darkened sky.

A teenager gazes into their distorted reflection on the water’s surface and wonders—

### Who Am I Without This Love I Thought Eternal?

With a trace of courage, they reach out, striving to grasp the truth beyond the illusion. As the windows of their heart open, a warm light touches a soul long chilled by false hopes.

Thoughts once built on misplaced dreams begin to crumble.

At the journey’s end, they are confronted with a profound question—

> What is love, truly?

Most, lost in apathy, continue to sing sweet songs of an idealized love, blind to the painful reality it conceals.

> True love,

Whispers a voice,

> is rooted in mutual respect, not control. It is understanding, not mere sacrifice.

With each step forward, they tread new paths, breaking through the fog that once clouded their judgment. And there, in the silence, a new light emerges, guiding them out of the shadows of false love and into true liberation.

Amid the turbulence of adolescence, they uncover a simple yet profound truth: true love is a journey, not a destination. And in that journey, they learn to love themselves first before forging bonds with others.

## Foolish, Yet Necessary.
