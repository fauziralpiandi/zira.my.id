title: Why ‘Clean Code’ is Overrated (Sometimes)
summary: Clean code is great—until it isn’t. When does it help, and when is it just over-engineered bullshit?

## 1. Clean Code vs. Shipping Fast

Alright, let’s be real—no one gives a damn about your meticulously crafted, poetry-level clean code if the damn feature isn’t shipped. You think your users care about how “elegant” your functions look? Nah, they just want the damn button to work.

In the real world, deadlines are brutal, and the only thing that matters is getting shit done. You can either spend hours obsessing over whether your variable names are _semantic enough_, or you can actually push a feature that, you know, **makes money**. That’s why most senior devs will tell you: **Done is better than perfect**.

> You think **Zuckerberg** wrote clean code for the first version of Facebook? **Hell no.** He hacked it together, and now we have a global privacy nightmare. **Priorities, bro!**

Of course, writing completely unreadable spaghetti is a one-way ticket to hell (a.k.a. debugging your own mess six months later). But let’s not pretend like every single function needs to be a goddamn masterpiece. If it works, is reasonably maintainable, and doesn’t make your teammates want to quit? Ship it.

## 2. Over-Engineering Kills Productivity

You ever seen code so _clean_ it’s fucking unreadable? Yeah, that’s the dark side of over-engineering. Some devs get so obsessed with “doing it the right way” that they turn a simple, functional piece of code into an abstract, over-architected monstrosity that requires a goddamn PhD to understand.

Like, bro, did we really need **seven** different classes, three layers of abstraction, and a [factory pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) just to parse a damn JSON file? No, we did not. But hey, at least it follows [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), right? (Spoiler: No one cares if it takes five hours to debug).

Some classic signs of over-engineering:

- **Excessive abstraction** — You have to open 10 files just to trace a function.
- **Overuse of design patterns** — Congrats, your codebase now looks like an academic case study.
- **Unnecessary complexity** — A simple function now requires five different dependencies.

This is the kind of shit that makes you question your life choices at 2 AM while staring at a **500-line class** that just **returns a string**.

Bottom line? If your “clean” code makes simple things needlessly complex, congratulations—you didn’t write _clean_ code. You wrote a fucking puzzle.

## 3. Maintainability is a Trade-Off

Ah, the sacred mantra of _clean code_—

**But what about maintainability?**

Listen, not every damn piece of code is meant to last forever. Sometimes, we’re just trying to get shit out the door, and that’s okay.

Not every project is a billion-dollar, decade-spanning system that requires pristine, scalable architecture. Sometimes, it’s a quick prototype, a one-off script, or a startup MVP that might not even survive the next funding round. Are we seriously gonna waste hours refactoring a disposable feature _just in case_ someone needs to touch it in the future? Spoiler: They probably won’t. And if they do, they’ll rewrite the damn thing anyway.

There are times when _clean code_ is just not worth it:

- **One-off scripts** — No one is maintaining that CSV parser you wrote last year.
- **Early-stage MVPs** — If the startup fails, who gives a shit about code quality?
- **Throwaway experiments** — Sometimes you just need to see if an idea works, not make it _scalable_.

Let’s be real, half of us have seen production code that looks like it was written in **a caffeine-induced panic attack**—and guess what? It’s still running just fine.

## 4. Context Fucking Matters

The problem with the _clean code_ cult is that they treat it like some universal law—like every single project, team, and situation should follow the same rigid-ass principles. But here’s the thing:

> **Context. Fucking. Matters.**

If you're working on a long-term, high-stakes system—say, banking software or a medical app where a single bug could ruin lives—then yeah, maybe obsessing over clean code makes sense. Structure that shit properly, make it readable, make it maintainable, do all the best practices. Because in that scenario, bad code isn’t just an inconvenience—it’s a potential disaster.

But if you’re hacking together an [MVP](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product/) for a startup that doesn’t even know if it'll be around next year, and you’re out here debating whether a function is _too long_ instead of shipping features? You’re wasting everyone’s time.

There’s no _one-size-fits-all_ rule. The key isn’t to blindly follow clean code principles like some holy scripture—it’s to **know when they matter and when they’re just getting in the way**.

## 5. Clean Code is Bullshit (Sometimes)

Let’s be brutally honest—what the hell even _is_ clean code? Ask ten developers, and you’ll get ten different answers. Some say it’s about readability. Others say it’s about maintainability. Some are out here writing functions with two-line docstrings just to feel morally superior.

What one dev calls “clean,” another calls a nightmare:

- **Functional vs OOP** — Some love pure functions, some think OOP is the only way.
- **Minimalism vs Explicitness** — “Why use one line when you can make it readable?” vs. “Why write 10 lines when one will do?”
- **Tabs vs Spaces** — JK, we all know tabs are better.

And don’t even get me started on “best practices.” Half of them are just trends that change every few years. Remember when everyone swore monoliths were bad and [microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) were the future? Yeah, now companies are crying about _microservice hell_ and realizing monoliths weren’t so bad after all.

## Know When to Give a Shit

Look, I’m not saying you should write unmaintainable garbage. Obviously, if you’re working on a serious, long-term codebase, you need to think about structure, readability, and best practices. But let’s not act like every single function needs to be a shining beacon of software engineering perfection.

Code is a tool. The goal isn’t _clean code_. The goal is **shippable, functional, and maintainable code that actually delivers value**. Sometimes that means keeping things neat. Sometimes that means hacking together a quick and dirty solution to meet a deadline.

So the next time someone tells you your code isn’t “clean enough,” just ask them:

**“Does it work? Does it ship? Does it make money?”**

If the answer is yes, then maybe—just maybe—clean code is a little overrated.
