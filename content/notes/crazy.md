## Sometimes, We Hold On Too Tight—

But maybe, just maybe, we’re meant to let go. Life is full of highs and lows—everyone wants to feel on top of the world, but the lows? They’re part of the deal too.

We all have chaos inside our heads. The late-night thoughts that won’t shut up, the moments when everything feels like a mess. But believe it or not, one day, you’ll wake up and feel like life is just beginning.

## Funny How We’re Always in a Rush to Grow Up,

Only to wish we could turn back time. We act like sleep can wait, but really—how much time do we even have? One thing’s for sure: **no matter what happens, we keep moving, keep vibing, keep dancing through it all.**

## Life Is Weird Like That,

Time never slows down, and we don’t realize how much things change until they already have. One day, you’ll meet someone who shifts your entire world. And sure, you won’t know if they’ll stay—but that’s the risk, isn’t it?

### So, Here’s to the Unpredictability—

To the rollercoaster that keeps us on our toes. Turn the music up, live in the moment, because someday, you’ll look back and realize—it was always meant to be.

### Love Comes and Goes in the Blink of an Eye,

People you never thought you’d lose can disappear overnight. But through all of it, we keep going, keep feeling, keep dancing.

Because life—no matter how insane it gets—is full of possibilities,

**And that’s crazy—**

If you ever see your shadow in the dark—make sure it’s really you XD
