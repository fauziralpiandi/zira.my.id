title: Time Will Tell? Yeah, Right
summary: Time is just space—you decide how to fill it. So if you’re still waiting? Well, I’m already ahead.

People love saying—

> **“Just give it time, and everything will make sense.”**

And every time I hear that, I can’t help but think… since when did **time become customer service for life?**

Be real—if you sit around waiting for time to hand you answers, you’ll wake up five (thousand) years from now with the same damn questions.

### Time Doesn’t Explain Things,

It just moves forward, completely indifferent to whether you’re lost, overthinking, or obsessing over things that won’t even matter a month from now.

But I get it. Saying **time will tell** is the easiest way to give yourself **fake reassurance**. Like, **“I have no clue what to do right now, so I’ll just let time figure it out for me.”** Problem is, time doesn’t work for you. You do. If you don’t ask, if you don’t try, if you don’t decide, you’re just gonna stay stuck until one day, it finally hits you—

> **“Oh. Nothing’s changing because I haven’t changed.”**

And honestly? Time doesn’t always make things clearer. Sometimes, it just makes them messier. You think waiting will bring you clarity, but all it does is pile up more doubts, more what-ifs, more roads not taken. Then suddenly, you’re standing there like,

> **“Damn… how did I even get here?!”**

Ever thought about this? Maybe it’s not time that gives us answers. Maybe it’s the small choices we make every day. You won’t magically understand a relationship just because years have passed—understanding comes from paying attention. You won’t **find yourself** just because time keeps ticking—**direction comes from trying, failing, learning**.

### That’s the Thing, Time Isn’t the Answer—

It’s just space—and you decide what to do with it. You can sit there. You can wait. You can convince yourself that someday, somehow, it’ll all just **click**. Or… you can actually get up and start looking for the answers yourself.

And if you’re still waiting for time to solve everything?

> **Well, f*ck that. You can sit there and wait like a dumbass all you want—I’m already on my damn way...**
