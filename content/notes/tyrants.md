## Amid the City’s Expanse,

A colossal statue stands tall, observing the small, hurried steps of those trapped in an endless cycle of ambition and bustle. With a face etched in rigidity, the statue embodies promises once spoken in grandiose, yet hollow, verses. It serves as a symbol of repressed hope, representing what should have upheld justice.

But in the end, has become little more than an obstruction on the road of life.

Behind the silk curtains that adorn the grandest halls, faint voices remain unheard, ensnared within the labyrinth of lies.

There, behind closed doors, the wielders of power gather, speaking a language only understood by the chosen few. They debate justice while outside, the reality is a never-ending suffering. It is as though they conduct an orchestra without instruments, producing only the hollow sound of a symphony in the dark corners of the city.

## Every Promise They Utter Is Marred by a Cacophony—

An ironic laughter in the background, exposing the emptiness of their grandiose declarations. The promise of welfare becomes nothing more than a fleeting wind, a decoration in an elaborate drama.

The marginalized, who should be the focal point, are instead swallowed by the silence, struggling against the tide of falsehoods offered to them.

**In the streets, people fight, suffocated by soaring costs, while above, the leaders feast in boundless luxury, betrayers of dreams, disregarding the faint voices seeking attention,**

In their refined tongues, they call it—

### Development—

An instrument for amassing wealth for a privileged few. Amidst it all, we, squeezed between hope and reality, are forced to silently witness this tragedy.

Where is the courage to acknowledge the deeply rooted injustice? It feels as though we live in a parallel world, where reality is concealed beneath layers of glittering paint. As individuals attempt to make their voices heard, their cries are drowned out by the ceaseless hum of the political machine. The powerholders grip the strings of authority with firm hands, while we stumble in confusion, wondering if there is any escape from this labyrinth of deceit.

Yet, in the midst of this sorrow, one thing remains clear:

## The Statue Will Continue to Watch, and We Will Continue to Fight.

But nothing is more painful than witnessing the arrogance parading before the faces weighed down with despair. In the shadow of forgotten laws, we may seem no more than dust swept by the wind, but that dust holds a story that will never fade. And in that story, we will persist in challenging the reality, dismantling the walls of injustice **that block the light of hope**—
